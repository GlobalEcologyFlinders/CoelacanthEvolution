These condition refers to the relation between the main canals and the canaliculi linking the pores at the surface of the bone and the main canal. In a few species, a few pores are present at the surface of a supraorbital but since the relationship between the pore and the canal is simple it is coded as single large pores (e.g., Guizhoucoelacanthus).

We considered that the lateral series primarily includes the tabular and supratemporal in actinistians with the exception of Miguashaia that also includes the intertemporal; the number of bones suturing laterally with the postparietal is taken into account in characters 20, 21 and 22. Character-state 2 corresponds to the condition where the otic canal runs at the suture between the postparietal and the lateral series of bones.
